# Blockchain_Supply_Chain
Proof of concept that stores supply chain data on a Blockchain network 
Combined https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app and nifeoluyemi/supply-block-chains. Used Oluyemi's UI to collect and display the blockchain data, and I used python_blockchain_app to create a blockchain network that distributes the blockchain data across multiple participants/nodes with consensus.
